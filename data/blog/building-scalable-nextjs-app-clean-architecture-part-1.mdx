summary: A comprehensive guide to initializing a Next.js application with App Router using clean architecture principles. Learn how to structure your project for maintainability and scalability from day one, based on 7 years of web development experience.

### 🧩 **Introduction**

After 7 years of building and scaling web apps, I’ve come to appreciate the value of starting strong with a clean, maintainable project structure. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I initialize a new **Next.js app** using the latest `App Router`, why I avoid the `/src` folder, and how I organize my folders to make things clean and enterprise-ready from day one.

### 📋 **Prerequisites**

Before we start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** version 18.x or higher
- **npm** installed globally
- Basic understanding of **React** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with terminal and CLI tools

### Initialize the Project

I prefer using the `npm create` command for simplicity:

```bash
npm create next-app@latest
```

You'll be prompted with a few questions. Here’s how I typically answer and what they mean:

| CLI Question | My Answer | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is your project named? | `next-enterprise-boilerplate` | Choose any name |
| Would you like to use TypeScript? | `Yes` | Strongly recommended for enterprise projects |
| Would you like to use ESLint? | `Yes` | Helps catch bugs and enforce code standards |
| Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? | `Yes` | Utility-first CSS makes styling more consistent |
| Would you like to use `src/` directory? | `No` | I prefer keeping the `app/` at the root for simplicity |
| Would you like to use App Router? | `Yes` | The future of routing in Next.js |
| Customize the default import alias? | `No` or set to `@/*` | Optional, but I usually update it later |

After running the CLI and completing the setup, the following folder structure is generated:

```bash
banda-next-boilerplate/
├── .git/
├── node_modules/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
│   ├── window.svg
│   ├── vercel.svg
│   ├── next.svg
│   ├── globe.svg
│   └── file.svg
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── next.config.ts
├── next-env.d.ts
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── eslint.config.mjs
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

Let me walk you through what each folder and file is for:

---

📂 `.git/`

- This hidden folder is created when you initialize a Git repo (`git init`), which `create-next-app` does automatically unless disabled.
- It contains your version control history and config.

📂 `node_modules/`

- Contains all the project’s dependencies as specified in `package.json`.
- This is managed automatically by your package manager (e.g., npm).

---

📂 `app/`

The core of your application when using the **App Router**.

- `page.tsx`:
    
    The root route (`/`) of your app. This is the homepage content.
    
- `layout.tsx`:
    
    Wraps all pages under this route. Think of this like your main layout template (navbar, footer, etc.).
    
- `globals.css`:
    
    Global styles for your entire app. Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities are usually imported here.
    
- `favicon.ico`:
    
    The favicon used by your browser tab.
    

> 🧠 In the App Router model, each folder in app/ represents a route, and special files like page.tsx, layout.tsx, and loading.tsx define behavior for that route.
> 

---

📂 `public/`

Used for static assets like images, fonts, and other media that don’t go through Webpack.

- All files here can be accessed directly at the root URL (`/vercel.svg`, `/globe.svg`, etc.)
- Recommended for storing logos, favicons, or document downloads.

---

📄 `package.json`

Defines your project’s metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

- Key sections include:
    - `"dependencies"`: runtime packages
    - `"devDependencies"`: tools like ESLint, Tailwind
    - `"scripts"`: commands like `dev`, `build`, `lint`, etc.

📄 `package-lock.json`

Auto-generated file that locks the versions of installed dependencies. Important for reproducible builds.

---

📄 `tsconfig.json`

TypeScript configuration file. Controls compiler settings and paths.

---

📄 `next.config.ts`

Next.js configuration file (in TypeScript). You can customize things like:

- Image domains
- Redirects/rewrite rules
- Experimental features

---

📄 `next-env.d.ts`

Automatically generated to ensure TypeScript understands Next.js-specific types.

- Don’t modify or delete this file manually.

---

📄 `postcss.config.mjs`

Used by Tailwind CSS for processing styles.

- This is where PostCSS plugins like `autoprefixer` are loaded.

---

📄 `eslint.config.mjs`

Your ESLint configuration using the new flat config format.

- Controls linting rules for your project.
- Ensures consistency and code quality.

---

📄 `README.md`

Basic documentation for your project. You can expand this later with setup instructions, environment variables, and contribution guidelines.

---

📄 `.gitignore`

Lists files and folders that Git should ignore.

Default includes:

- `node_modules/`
- `.next/`
- Environment files (`.env*`)
- OS-specific files like `.DS_Store`

### ✂️ **Optional Cleanup: Moving Icons & Styles**

Before wrapping up, there’s one small tweak I like to make right away for better organization:

- **Move `favicon.ico`** from `app/` to the `public/` folder
- **Move `globals.css`** from `app/` to a top-level `styles/` folder (e.g., `styles/globals.css`)

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
# Create a styles folder if you don’t have one
mkdir styles

# Move the CSS file
mv app/globals.css styles/globals.css

# Then update the import in app/layout.tsx

```

Update your `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
tsx
CopyEdit
import '../styles/globals.css'

```

> 🧼 This keeps the app/ folder focused strictly on routing and page logic, while visual assets and styles live in more conventional places (public/ and styles/).
> 

### 🧠 **Conclusion**

By using `npm create next-app@latest` and customizing the CLI options to your needs, you’ve just laid a solid foundation for your Next.js project — one that’s cleaner, simpler, and better suited for enterprise-grade applications.

Before wrapping up, I also like to make a quick adjustment for clarity and maintainability:

- Move `favicon.ico` into the `public/` folder
- Move `globals.css` into a top-level `styles/` folder

This keeps the `app/` directory focused strictly on routing and layout logic, while static assets and global styles are stored in more conventional, centralized locations.

We’ve walked through every file and folder generated by default, explaining how each one plays a part in your app's architecture. By skipping the `src/` directory and leveraging the power of the App Router, you get a structure that’s easier to navigate and more scalable for teams from the very beginning.
